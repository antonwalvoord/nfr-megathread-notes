## Weekly Goals (Week of February 17)

###### **For Harness**
- [ ] I have been focused largely on PDM recently but now I will be checking in on the progress that Harness has been making and seeing what has been manufactured and what is still in design consideration. I also think it would be good to lay out the portions we have on the table to do a sanity check on if everything is looking correct

- [ ] Use your measurements you took to begin cutting sections of cabling and labelling them for what they'll be used for. We'll get this done and form the vague semblance of the harness and then begin assembly.
	- *Labelling:* It will be very important to appropriately label these strips so we are organized and can quickly pack/unpack the work we've done between meetings!
	- Look through the RapidHarness design to see what makes sense to have as cabling and what should have strands of wire removed to be run independently. Check with me and then cut accordingly
- [ ] *For maintenance panel:* decide on a final purchase for TSMP wiring and I'll send out a purchase order for it

###### **For PDM**
- [ ] Continue working on the software for PDM
- [ ] Review the new layout so you can feel comfortable with assembly and testing when it arrives

###### **For LV Charger**
- [ ] Review PDR and schematic comments with me
- [ ] Schedule a PDR
