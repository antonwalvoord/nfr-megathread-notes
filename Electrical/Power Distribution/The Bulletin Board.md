## Weekly Goals (Week of January 27)

###### **For Harness**
- [ ] *Recommended:* If you're interested in knowing more about how CAN works, read through [this DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/blog/the-basics-of-the-controller-area-network) article or [this one](https://forum.digikey.com/t/overview-of-the-can-bus-protocol/21170) and [this article about CAN errors](https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/can-bus-errors-intro-tutorial) 
- [ ] Use your measurements you took to begin cutting sections of cabling and labelling them for what they'll be used for. We'll get this done and form the vague semblance of the harness and then begin assembly.
	- *Labelling:* It will be very important to appropriately label these strips so we are organized and can quickly pack/unpack the work we've done between meetings!
	- Look through the RapidHarness design to see what makes sense to have as cabling and what should have strands of wire removed to be run independently. Check with me and then cut accordingly

###### **For LV Charger**
- [ ] Review PDR and schematic comments with me
- [ ] Schedule a PDR

###### **For PDM**
- [ ] Get new member caught up on the status of the project and the steps moving forward
- [ ] Review possible BJT replacement circuit with me
- [ ] Continue working on the software for PDM and waiting for the new PMOS to come
