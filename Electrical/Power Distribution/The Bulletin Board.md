## Weekly Goals (Week of January 20)

###### **For Harness**
- [ ] If you're interested in knowing more about how CAN works, read through [this DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/blog/the-basics-of-the-controller-area-network) article or [this one](https://forum.digikey.com/t/overview-of-the-can-bus-protocol/21170) and [this article about CAN errors](https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/can-bus-errors-intro-tutorial) 
- [ ] Review the [[Harness]] design as a whole or at least the portion you're in charge of manufacturing, referencing the [[Car Architecture#Overview|electrical architecture]] might be useful
- [ ] Start to take some general measurements down that will be helpful for bundle lengths during manufacturing. You should take measurements in the autobay rather than in the CAD because at this point we're dealing with what has been manufactured and there may be *minor* differences. We'll need to do this before we can make anything
	- *Note:* You should take note of accurate lengths but also pay attention to the geometry of the surrounding area. Does it seem like you'll need a particularly large amount of slack? Or only a little? Write all of this information down in a centralized document in the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1XJQPlfdeBkZnX8IhdU2FMexnPGzltzIY) 
	- This is a good time to do this when the frame is still very bare bones and there isn't that much in the way of taking measurements. Things will start to pile on the car and make it more difficult for you to get in there

###### **For LV Battery**
- [ ] Meet with the people from Accumulator and make plans moving forward

###### **For LV Charger**
- [ ] Review PDR and schematic comments with me
- [ ] Schedule a PDR

###### **For PDM**
- [ ] Plan for failure about the PMOS, what solutions can you think of if the PMOS doesn't work? What alternative circuit should we use? I'd like to discuss this and see what your thoughts are
- [ ] Continue working on the software for PDM and waiting for the new PMOS to come

## Monthly Goals (January)

###### **For Harness**
- [ ] *Completely* finalize internal harness designs
- [ ] ~~External Harnesses largely manufactured~~ (*This was a bit too optimistic I think*)
- [ ] Begin testing of external harness

###### **For PDM**
- [ ] Solve overcurrent protection issue
- [ ] Complete [testing plans](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ojkzd-2abVfz04r5hTp6LYRJP8-pr1D0azjeg3GUBKw/edit?usp=sharing) 
- [ ] Finish first draft of software (sans bugfixing)

###### **For LV Charger**
- [ ] Finish schematic and layout
- [ ] Complete a DR
- [ ] Have a design ready to be ordered for manufacture
