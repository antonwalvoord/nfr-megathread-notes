# About:
Power Distribution is in charge of all of the grounded low voltage (GLV) power throughout the car. It also handles signal propagation both inside and outside of enclosures through the [[Harness]]. It supplies power from the [[LV Battery]] which is distributed by the [[Power Distribution Module]] and charged by the [[LV Charger]].
