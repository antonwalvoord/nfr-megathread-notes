### Project Information
- #### Scope/Interactions:
	- Car-wide: Every electrical component on the car is connected to the harness in order to provide a path for power and/or data
- #### Description:
	- This is the largest project under Power Distribution and we will spend most of the year purchasing, manufacturing, and validating the design. The harness is the system of wires running throughout the car which connects every electrical device. This involves creating bundles of wires and routing them along the frame while considering EMI, current limits, and signal integrity. This is a manufacturing intensive project where a lot of time will be spent handling cables, crimps, splices, heatshrink, and connectors. Communication is particularly important in this project because we are working with many different stakeholders and we need to ensure that each device is getting the power and data it is expecting or things will break (possibly in sparks, so communication is a must)
