>[!WARNING] Altium is **Windows only!**
>In order to use Altium on a Mac you'll first need to set up [[UTM (Free Windows Emulator) Setup Guide|UTM]], a free windows emulator, or [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/), a paid windows emulator.
>
>If you don't want to install or set up any emulators you can also use [Apporto](https://northwestern.apporto.com/), which is a virtual machine hosted by Northwestern. *This route has easier setup but a worse experience*
