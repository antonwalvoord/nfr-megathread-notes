### General Notes
Use \*\*Bold\*\* text to indicate if you're making a **Note:**
\=\=Highlight\=\= and/or \*italicize\* text that is ==particularly== *important*
In order to represent variables, use backticks. For example, if we want to refer to the variable `x` we would write \`x\`

The purpose of the megathread is to be highly navigable and interconnected with information. We want information to be as accessible as possible, so to that end you should use \[\[links\]\] as much as possible (within reason). This will allow users to **realize** that more information is out there and **access** it easily
### Code
Use backticks to denote code: i.e. **\`Example Code\`**, which looks like `Example Code` when rendered

Use triple backticks to denote blocks of code **\`\`\`Example Code\`\`\`**, which looks like the snippet below when rendered
```
Example Code
```
### Math

On the off chance that you need to write equations, Obsidian **does** support "Math Blocks" using \$\$ "Some Math" \$\$

**Example:** \$\$ X(jw)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}x(t)e^{-jwt}dt \$\$

$$X(jw)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}x(t)e^{-jwt}dt$$
