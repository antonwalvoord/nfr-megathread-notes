### Electrical
##### Tractive System (TS)
By **EV.1.1**: Every part electrically connected to the Motor(s) and/or Accumulator(s)
##### Grounded Low Voltage (GLV)
By **EV.1.2**: Every electrical part that is not part of the Tractive System. More rules found in **EV.4.4** - must be Grounded to the Chassis and able to operate with the [[#Accumulator]] removed from the vehicle
##### Accumulator
By **EV.1.3**: All the battery cells or super capacitors that store the electrical energy to be used by the Tractive System. More rules found in **EV.5.1**
##### Energy Meter
Described in **EV.3.2**. Measures power and voltage of the accumulator to ensure [[FSAE 2025 Rules|rules]] compliance to **EV.3.3**
##### Motor Controller / Inverter
Supplies power from the [[#Accumulator]] to the motor. Converts DC to AC and regulates how much power goes to the motor based on a number of conditions, including torque requests from the [[ECU]]
##### Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor (APPS)
Described in **T.4.2**. Measures how far the accelerator pedal is depressed in order to determine how much power should go to the motor
##### Brake System Encoder (BSE)
Described in **T.4.3**. Measures brake system pressure.
##### Maintenance Plugs
Described by **EV.5.3**. Electrically connects and disconnects [[#Accumulator]] segments from one another.
