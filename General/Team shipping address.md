The following address delivers to the "office", which is in the very lowest floor of the Ford Design Center. Note that Ford falls in the really small zip code of 60208, whereas most of the rest of the area has 60201, but putting in 60201 will also work. 

2133 Sheridan Rd
S.B. 250
Evanston IL 60208

*In truth, the package will first go to the shipping and receiving loading dock in Tech, which the autobay is across from in the alley between Tech and Ford. Then, the shipping and receiving people like Antonio (See [[Useful contacts]]) (super friendly guy, still working there as of Jan 2025) will hand-deliver the package to the office.*
