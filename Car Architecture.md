# Mechanical
Our vehicle is a single motor + differential car. Many other teams have more sophisticated drivetrains, including setups with hub motors, which allow you to eliminate all spinning shafts inboard of the wheels.
We have stuck with the traditional single motor + differential setup for simplicity.
ðŸš§I need help for thisðŸš§

#### Shutdown Circuit
The shutdown circuit (Described in [[FSAE 2025 Rules|EV.7.2]]) is a safety mechanism which serves to disconnect the [[Team Terminology (Glossary)#Tractive System (TS)|Tractive System]] either automatically or manually. This is done through a series of switches and [[Team Terminology (Glossary)#Interlocks|interlocks]] which can break power supply to the [[Team Terminology (Glossary)#Isolation Relays (IR)|IR'S]] thus isolating the Tractive System from the outside world to protect us from the high voltage. For specifics on the wiring, see the drawing below.

#### CAN (Controller Area Network)
CAN is a rugged information bus protocol that allows many devices to communicate with one another over a limited number of wires (two per bus). This means that devices can only communicate with other devices on the same bus (unless they use another device which is on both busses as an intermediary).

On NFR25 we originally designed to have two separate CAN busses but have modified our designs to use a single bus instead.

>[!Warning] All boards have been migrated over to the **DRIVE** bus. The *DATA* bus now is purely vestigial as it is not worth the effort of extracting it from the cabling in the harness.

Our two CAN busses are called *DATA* and **DRIVE** CAN. *DATA* is (as the name suggests) intended for purely data acquisition purposes and is not [[Team Terminology (Glossary)#Drive Critical|drive critical]]. **DRIVE** contains information directly related to controlling the driving of the car and is drive critical. There are two buses to reduce the [[Team Terminology (Glossary)#Bus Load|bus load]] of any one bus which is intended to make the car's communication network more robust.

>[!note] For more low level information on how CAN actually works, refer to [this article on DigiKey](https://forum.digikey.com/t/overview-of-the-can-bus-protocol/21170) or [this](https://www.digikey.com/en/blog/the-basics-of-the-controller-area-network) one, as well as [this](https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/can-bus-errors-intro-tutorial) article on CAN errors

The drawing below denotes which devices are connected to which CAN busses, arranged as to approximate location within the car.

## Power Distribution
All [[Team Terminology (Glossary)#Grounded Low Voltage (GLV)|GLV]] power is supplied by the [[#Low Voltage (LV) Battery|LV Battery]]. It runs throughout the car at an unregulated voltage straight from the battery (20-25V generally). It is then regulated down on a per-board basis as needed. Some projects like the [[Wheel Brokers]] have regulated voltage being fed to them from a parent board over a short distance.
